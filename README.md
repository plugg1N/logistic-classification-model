## ü§© Linear Regression Model

This is my third project on Machine Learning. This project is made for educational purpose. This is the task from "–°–∏—Ä–∏—É—Å - –ö—É—Ä—Å—ã –ø–æ –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–Ω–æ–º—É –æ–±—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—é". Task was to create a Machine-Learning **LogisticClassification** model

There is a csv file, that represents information *(factors)* that has some hidden relation to "satisfaction" of the customers.

Task required me to create a **LinearLogisticClassification** model in order to predict if customer is satisfied with his flight. All the factors were created and collected by a company, that made up a test for its customers

I have discovered the most useful numeric and categorial factors in order to optimize the model of classification. All parameteres are scaled.


## üéØ Results

Those are **RESULTS** (accuracy/precision/recall):
